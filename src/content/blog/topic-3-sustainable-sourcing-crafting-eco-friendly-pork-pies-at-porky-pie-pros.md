# Topic 3: Sustainable Sourcing – Crafting Eco-Friendly Pork Pies at Porky Pie Pros

Welcome back to our ongoing series exploring the world of premium pork pies! If you've followed Topics 1 and 2, where we delved into the history and baking techniques behind our signature pies, you're in for a treat. Today, in Topic 3, we're shining a spotlight on **sustainable sourcing** – a core pillar of Porky Pie Pros' philosophy that ensures every bite is not just delicious, but also kind to the planet.

## Why Sustainability Matters in Pie Making

At Porky Pie Pros, we believe that great food starts with great ingredients. But in an era of climate challenges, it's not enough to source quality pork and pastry – we must do so responsibly. Pork production can have a significant environmental impact, from water usage to greenhouse gas emissions. That's why we've partnered with local, ethical farms that prioritize animal welfare and regenerative agriculture. Our pigs are raised on pasture, fed non-GMO feed, and never treated with unnecessary antibiotics. This isn't just good for the animals; it's better for the soil, reducing erosion and enhancing biodiversity.

## Local Ingredients: From Farm to Fork

One of our proudest initiatives is sourcing 90% of our ingredients within a 100-mile radius of our bakery. This cuts down on transportation emissions and supports regional economies. Picture this: fresh apples from nearby orchards for our seasonal apple-pork pie variants, or herbs from community gardens that add that zesty kick to our classic recipes. By keeping things local, we ensure peak freshness – meaning our pies burst with flavor straight from the oven.

## Innovations in Packaging and Waste Reduction

Sustainability extends beyond the ingredients. We've switched to compostable packaging made from plant-based materials, eliminating single-use plastics from our supply chain. Inside the bakery, we repurpose food scraps into compost for local farms, closing the loop on waste. These small changes add up: last year alone, we diverted over 5 tons of waste from landfills!
