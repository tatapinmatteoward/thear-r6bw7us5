# Elevate Your Pies: Mastering Lattice Tops in PieCraft Pro – Topic 5

Welcome back to our ongoing exploration of PieCraft Pro, the ultimate app for pie enthusiasts! If you've been following our series, you've already mastered basic crusts and fillings. Now, in Topic 5, we're diving into the art of lattice tops – those beautiful, woven patterns that turn a simple pie into a showstopper.

## Why Lattice Tops?
Lattice designs aren't just pretty; they allow steam to escape during baking, preventing soggy bottoms and ensuring even cooking. Plus, they showcase fresh fruit fillings through the gaps. In PieCraft Pro, creating them is as easy as drag-and-drop, with customizable templates to match your skill level.

## Step-by-Step Guide in PieCraft Pro
1. **Select Your Base**: Start a new project and choose your pie shell. The app's 3D preview lets you visualize the final product.

2. **Prepare Strips**: Use the dough tool to generate even strips. Adjust thickness and length – pro tip: thinner strips (1/4 inch) create delicate weaves.

3. **Weave Magic**: Activate the lattice mode. Lay strips horizontally, then vertically, and let PieCraft Pro auto-weave them. For custom patterns, toggle manual mode and follow the guided overlays.

4. **Customize and Bake**: Add edges with crimping tools, then simulate baking to check for flaws. Export your recipe or share directly to social media!

## Pro Tips for Perfection
- **Flavor Pairings**: Pair lattice with berry pies for vibrant colors peeking through.
- **Common Mistakes**: Avoid over-twisting strips; PieCraft Pro's error detector highlights issues.
- **Time-Saver**: The app's AI suggests patterns based on your filling – try the classic diamond weave for apple pie.
