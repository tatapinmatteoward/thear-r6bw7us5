# Mastering Lattice Tops in PieCraft Pro

Welcome back to our PieCraft Pro series! In Topic 4, we're tackling one of the most elegant pie decorations: the lattice top. This crisscross pattern not only looks beautiful but also allows steam to escape during baking, ensuring a flaky crust.

## Why Choose Lattice Tops?
Lattice designs add a rustic charm to fruit pies, showcasing the filling beneath. With PieCraft Pro's simulation features, you can preview your design before baking, saving time and ingredients.

## Step-by-Step Guide Using PieCraft Pro
1. **Prepare Your Dough**: Roll out your pie crust to about 1/8-inch thickness. PieCraft Pro's recipe module suggests ideal dough recipes based on your pie size.

2. **Cut Strips**: Use the app's virtual cutter tool to slice strips of varying widths. Experiment with 1/2-inch to 1-inch for dynamic patterns.

3. **Weave the Lattice**: Lay strips horizontally, then weave vertical ones over and under. PieCraft Pro offers an augmented reality overlay to guide your hands in real-time.

4. **Seal and Bake**: Trim excess dough, crimp edges, and bake as per your recipe. The app tracks baking times for perfect results.

## Pro Tips
- For a glossy finish, brush with egg wash.
- Try flavored strips with cinnamon for apple pies.
- Simulate fillings in PieCraft Pro to test visual appeal.
