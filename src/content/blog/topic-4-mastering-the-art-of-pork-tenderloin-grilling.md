# Mastering the Art of Pork Tenderloin Grilling

Welcome back to The Porky Pantry, where we dive deep into all things pork! If you've been following our series, you know we're building up to pork perfection. In Topic 4, we're firing up the grill to tackle one of the most versatile cuts: pork tenderloin. This lean, flavorful meat is a staple in any pork lover's pantry, and with the right techniques, it transforms into a showstopper at your next cookout.

## Why Pork Tenderloin?
Pork tenderloin is the 'filet mignon' of pork—tender, mild, and quick-cooking. At about 1-2 pounds per piece, it's perfect for weeknight dinners or feeding a crowd. But beware: overcooking can turn it tough. The key? Temperature control and a killer marinade.

## Essential Grilling Tips
1. **Prep Like a Pro**: Start with a room-temperature tenderloin. Pat it dry and trim any silver skin for even cooking.
2. **Marinate for Flavor**: Let it soak in a mix of olive oil, garlic, soy sauce, honey, and herbs for at least 2 hours (overnight is best).
3. **Grill Smart**: Preheat your grill to medium-high (about 400°F). Sear on all sides for 2-3 minutes each, then move to indirect heat until it hits 145°F internally.
4. **Rest and Slice**: Let it rest for 5 minutes post-grill. This locks in juices for that melt-in-your-mouth texture.

## Featured Recipe: Honey-Garlic Grilled Pork Tenderloin
### Ingredients (Serves 4):
- 1.5 lb pork tenderloin
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 3 tbsp honey
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp olive oil

### Instructions:
1. Whisk together marinade ingredients in a bowl.
2. Place tenderloin in a zip-top bag, pour in marinade, and refrigerate for 2-8 hours.
3. Remove from fridge 30 minutes before grilling.

5. Slice thinly and serve with grilled veggies or a fresh salad.
